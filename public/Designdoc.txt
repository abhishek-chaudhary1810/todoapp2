-This Web App is created to understand and implement a better understanding of react framework.
-This is not another todo App , this web app signifies my current understanding of react framework.
-This will be created from scratch (just not the boilerplate code provided by create-react-app;-)).
-In this Web App following following folder structure is used :
    -Public folder for all the assets
    -Src Include all the files.
    -Src/Components Folder for all the individual components.
    -src/Index.js is root file.
    -src/web-vitals to check the performance of the App.
